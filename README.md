- ðŸ‘‹ Hello World, Iâ€™m Georgiy.
- Iâ€™m interested in data science and neuroscience, particularly understanding brain networks and how they form. I have a PhD in neuroscience.
- Iâ€™m currently learning how to analyze neural activity patterns from advanced imaging experiments, such as in vivo 2-photon (2P) imaging.
- I am open to collaboration on 2P analysis projects.
- I also have 2 years of experiences working as a data scientist at a fast-growing start-up.
I would also be interested in working on projects with positive social impact where I can use my industry-level coding skills (ETL and prediction).
- ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out!
